# OnMyWay

“On My Way” is a sweet and meaningful interactive story about the journey, not the destination.
Shape your experience with the help of a handy travel journal, and discover how you can help make the world a better place.

This vertical slice was developed as a collaborative project for the 6th semester of our Digital Games bachelors studies at the Cologne Game Lab. With the theme "Sustainable Travel" given to us by Green Erasmus, the experience aims to educate players about their options when considering their trip to an exchange semester and increase awareness to the advantages of slow travel over fast travel.
